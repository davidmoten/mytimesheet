#summary Documentation of the WinWin key value storage and retrieval system

= Introduction =

WinWin provides key-value pair storage with optional authentication. The api is
  * get
  * put
  * append
  * copy
Google App Engine quotas limit an individual upload to <10MB and for a HTTP Post parameter to 200K. The *append* method is useful in this case. 

Given that updating a key can involve multiple uploads (via *put* and *append*), you may want to update a temporary key in this way and then use the *copy* method to move the information to the key you want to update.
