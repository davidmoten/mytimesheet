    <desc>Thirty-three intimate, live concerts. Thirty-three exceptional artists and bands with a balance between some older, classic artists and younger musicians. The show takes place in the Berkley Church on Queen Street in Toronto and is more like a nightclub and less like a concert theatre, giving it a different look than other music shows.</desc>

    <title>Zoo Days</title>
    <desc>Narrated by Jane Horrocks, Zoo Days is an entertaining new wildlife series following the engaging characters, both animal and human, at two of Britain's largest zoos. With incredible behind-the-scenes access at Chester and Colchester Zoos, the series features a variety of storylines and strong personalities providing a mix of excitement, jeopardy and fun. We will experience close encounters with the scariest reptiles and the cutest baby monkeys, and find out what happens in the everyday lives of the zoo keepers. As well as playing host to nearly two million visitors a year between them, both zoos are heavily committed to conservation and training. Chester Zoo - the biggest zoo in Britain - is building an intensive conservation programme aimed at ensuring the survival of global animal species, while Colchester is the first ever - and currently only - UK zoo to have set up its own nature reserve in Africa, protecting endangered creatures in their natural habitat. In the first episode of Zoo Days two African black rhinos at Chester Zoo lock horns in a frightening lovers' tiff. Rosie and Quinto take an instant dislike to each other and their keepers are forced to intervene.</desc>

    <title>Sunday Arts</title>
    <sub-title>2009-10-25</sub-title>
    <desc>Luna Park is recognised as one of Sydney's enduring icons. It is a heritage landmark and, despite the changes wrought over the decades, is celebrated as one of the last surviving amusement parks of its era with its remarkable collection of art deco, Moorish and futuristic structures peppered with images from Australian and American popular culture from the 1930s to the present. The Art Of Fun explores the art of Luna Park and the people who created it - through archival footage, photographs and interviews with the artists.  Much of Luna Park's unique appeal has derived from its fairground art : the murals inside Coney Island, the backdrops to the games, the facades and bridges on the games and rides and of course the huge entrance face that has come to symbolise the park itself. What began as a grimacing visage became a laughing larrikin who embodied the cheeky side of Australian culture.  The artists featured include Rupert Browne who designed the original face and many of the first rides; Arthur Barton, who in 35 years as resident artist, gave the park its happy face and its comic and very Australian backdrop: Martin Sharp, Peter Kingston, Garry Shead and Leigh Hobbs, who recognised Barton's legacy, giving it a pop art twist, and Ashley Taylor who worked at the park in the early 90s continues the tradition as Luna Park's current Artist-In-Residence.  Luna Park has been able to survive all these years. Its very position has made it vulnerable to development, yet it has managed to adapt and retain parts of its original features and feelings for all those who visit it today. Sunday Arts: The Art Of Fun will be repeated on ABC2 - Sunday, October 25 at 7:30pm</desc>

    <title>With Gilbert And George</title>
    <desc>After modelling for Gilbert and George in 1986, Julian Cole turned his camera on them. His moving portrait filmed over 17 years, reveals Gilbert and George's unique relationship, and traces their lives from humble beginnings to their role on the world's artistic stage, where they have performed an enduring and controversial double act for over four decades. Banned by the authorities and panned by the critics, they are loved and hated with unprecedented ferocity. This film reveals the individuals that are two people inside a single artist, a permanent living sculpture in which they are compelled to be inseparable from each other and their art.  Gilbert and George's motto 'Art for All' has seen them mount more exhibitions around the world than any other living artist. Cole captures their groundbreaking shows in Russia, China and beyond while regularly taking viewers inside their home and studio created in 1969 in Spitalfields, East London.</desc>
